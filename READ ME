Azure Infrastructure Project: Custom VM Deployment with Firewall Security
Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced Azure cloud infrastructure skills by implementing a complete solution that includes:
•	Custom VM Image Creation using Azure Compute Gallery
•	Multi-VM Deployment from custom images
•	Network Security with Azure Firewall
•	Infrastructure as Code principles
Architecture
The solution consists of the following components:
•	2x Virtual Machines deployed from custom images
•	1x Azure Firewall for network security
•	1x Azure Compute Gallery for image management
•	1x Virtual Network with proper subnet segmentation
•	Custom web application pre-installed on all VMs

Technical Implementation
Phase 1: Custom Image Creation
1.	Created a base Windows Server 2022 VM.
2.	Installed and configured IIS Web Server.
3.	Developed a custom web application.
4.	Generalized the VM and captured it as a managed image.
5.	Stored the image in Azure Compute Gallery for reusability and rapid deployment.
Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment
1.	Deployed 2x VMs (WebServer1, WebServer2) from the custom image.
2.	Configured appropriate networking and security groups for the VMs.
3.	Verified successful application deployment across both VM instances.
Phase 3: Network Security Implementation
1.	Deployed Azure Firewall (Standard SKU) for network security.
2.	Configured application rules for web traffic (HTTP/HTTPS).
3.	Implemented network rules for internal communication between VMs.
4.	Established NAT rules for secure remote access.

Security Features
•	Network Segmentation: Separate subnets for VMs and firewall management to isolate and protect resources.
•	Traffic Control: Centralized firewall rules for controlling all inbound and outbound traffic.
•	Access Management: Granular policies to control inbound/outbound traffic and secure access to resources.
•	Infrastructure Protection: Azure Firewall acts as the network security hub, offering comprehensive protection.
Key Achievements
•	Scalable Architecture: Custom images enable rapid and consistent VM deployment.
•	Security Best Practices: Implemented a defense-in-depth strategy with network segmentation and centralized firewall rules.
•	Cost Optimization: Leveraged Standard SKU for Azure Firewall, balancing feature richness with cost efficiency.
•	Automation Ready: The infrastructure is templated for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment using tools like ARM templates or Terraform.
Technologies Used
•	Azure Virtual Machines: Core compute infrastructure for deploying web servers.
•	Azure Compute Gallery: Efficient image management and distribution of custom VM images.
•	Azure Firewall: Ensures network security and traffic control for the entire architecture.
•	Azure Virtual Network: Provides secure and segmented network infrastructure.
•	IIS Web Server: Hosts the custom web application on each VM.
•	Windows Server 2022: The operating system used for all VMs.
Results
•	Successfully deployed a scalable web infrastructure with multiple VMs.
•	Achieved centralized network security management using Azure Firewall.
•	Demonstrated enterprise-grade Azure architecture skills in building secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.
Future Enhancements
•	Implement Azure Load Balancer for enhanced high availability.
•	Integrate Azure Application Gateway for additional web application firewall security.
•	Add Azure Monitor for comprehensive logging and monitoring of the infrastructure.
•	Automate future deployments using ARM templates or Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
